Abstract factory pattern:
many more abstract classes 
in any project we use those factory classes to desine our concreate class model
abstraction can acheive by interface and abstract classes only 
it forms of the creational pattern and gives us the best approach to create object from that factory
for example a factory of all sql classes like odbc,opeb db mysql ,mssql form a factory to give us connection to the database
